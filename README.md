Overview: This project is a UI/UX redesign of the Sertie web application to improve its user experience, visual appeal, and accessibility. The goal is to make the platform more engaging and seamless, increasing student sign-ups and retention.

The issues I found in the existing website are: 
1. The website looks old-fashioned and lacks a modern touch.
2. The video gets stuck and doesn't play smoothly.
3. The website loads slowly, making navigation frustrating.
4. The colors used are not visually appealing or engaging.
5. When we view the website specifically on our phone, 
     - Some text requires horizontal scrolling to read fully.
     - The video appears too small on mobile screens.
     - Buttons are oversized and take up too much space.

The improvements I can suggest is:
1. Implement a cleaner layout, better typography, and a more appealing color scheme.
2. Optimize video loading or use a different format to ensure smooth playback.
3. Optimize images, minimize unnecessary code, and implement caching techniques.
4. Adjust layout to prevent horizontal scrolling.
5. Use better contrast and more engaging colors for improved readability and aesthetics.
6. Ensure the video dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes.
7. Make buttons proportional to the design without being too large.
